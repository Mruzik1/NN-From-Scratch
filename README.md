# NN-From-Scratch (Backprop From Scratch)
There are two versions of the neural network here:
  - **An old one (all .py files)**: I made it almost a year ago (uploaded later tho); back then I had no much experience in machine learning and just finished my first year at the university.
  - **A new one (.ipynb files)**: Was made as a university assignment with more experience in the field.<br />

New NN has better stability, flexibility, and is producing good results (unlike the old neural network). The main differences between those two are:
  - **The code structure;**
  - **Weights initialization:** the new one uses numpy's normal distribution;
  - **New NN uses delta rule in order to achieve better performance;**<br /><br />
  
*P.S. If you, by some chance, want to see my "thinking process" during the neural network implementation, here's the mind-mapping whiteboard. It's messy and quite hard to understand, but can be useful anyways (and sorry for the bad quality) :)* <br />
