# NN-From-Scratch (Backprop From Scratch)
There are two versions of the neural network here: an old one (all .py files) and a new one (.ipynb files). New NN has better stability, flexibility, and is producing good results (unlike the old neural network).

The main differences between those two are:
  - **The code structure**
  - **Weights initialization:** the new one uses numpy's normal distribution
  - **New NN uses delta rule in order to achieve better performance**
  
*P.S. It is also a university assignment :D*
